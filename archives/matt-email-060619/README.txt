# README for parasites in Gorongosa and their spatial distribution

Repeated study across taxa lends support to the hypothesis that grazing
ungulates avoid foraging near feces to avoid infection by fecal-oral parasites.
However this observation and others with different infections was recently used
to propose a 'landscape of disgust'. A landscape of disgust proposes that animal
behavior, particularly space use, is at least partially determined by the distribution
of infection risk. Here, we leverage several lines of evidence to examine this idea in
Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique.

Hypotheses:

1(a) Areas of high animal use are high in parasite transmission risk
 (b) Areas of high animal use are low in transmission risk due to
 	 parasite avoidance/inhospitability for parasites

Components:

(0) At the broadest scale, is there a positive correlation between
habitat-wise density and EPG?
- floodplain vs. savanna EPG and densities. Aggregated and species-level

(1) At more local scales, what is the observed relationship between 
EPG and RAI?
- species-wise tests of correlation between the two
- all assemblage and floodplain grazers only
	*Pattern seems to vary by species but low sample size and
	inconsistent trends yield little proof. Distinct lack of 
	signal at whole assemblage scale but some signal emerges 
	in some cases at smaller scales

# Perhaps remove: (2) Why is there a lack of pattern at the large scale?
- look at the parasite assemblages of some species to extrapolate
	* There is distinct separation in parasite communities based
	on host identity. This analysis lacks the definition that would
	be ideal due to the species chosen

(3) Is the landscape of disgust predictable in Gorongosa and how 
does predicted LOD relate to RAI?
- plot LOD and RAI side by side. Estimated LOD should show the same pattern with RAI as observed data

Curtis 2014: Herbivores face another trade-off dilemma. Soils that
have been fertilized with dung produce more nutritious
grass, but also contain more parasite larvae. In feeding
tests, sheep avoided grass laced with gastrointestinal
nematode-containing faeces [54]. Reindeer and caribou
may migrate each year because they are looking for clean,
dung-free pasture on which to feed, calve, and bring up
their young [55].

Hutchings et al 2000: Mammalian herbivores cannot detect
gastrointestinal parasitic larvae themselves, but use faeces
as a cue to avoid ingestion of parasites (Cooper
1997; Hutchings et al. 1998). If, as suggested above, animals
should forage on nutrient-enriched and tall herbage
in areas of high faecal contamination, they then run the
risk of ingesting infective helminth larvae. The foraging
herbivore is, therefore, faced with a trade-off between
nutrient and parasite ingestion, and foraging decisions
should be expected in relation to the consequences of the
benefits of increased nutrient ingestion versus the costs
of increased parasitic infection...However, adding faeces to tall swards
and/or fertilising short swards in choices 1–6 did significantly
affect the degree of selection for tall swards; both
acted to reduce selection. In this experiment a doubling
of sward height had far more impact on herbivore foraging
decisions in relation to faecal contaminated swards,
than a doubling of sward N content. All else being equal,
a doubling of sward height transformed the strong inherent
avoidance of faecal contaminated swards (Hutchings
et al. 1998) into strong selection for tall, faecal contaminated
swards.

Hutchings et al 2001: Herbivores cannot
detect the parasites themselves on swards and thus use
the presence of faeces as an environmental cue to their
presence (Cooper et al. 2000)...There were significant animal treatment effects on
patch selection (Fig. 2). All animals similarly and significantly
selected noncontaminated patches for grazing over
faeces-contaminated patches at the start of the grazing.

Ezenwa 2004: Selective defecation and selective
foraging are two behaviors that have been discussed as potential defense strategies
used by grazing ungulates to reduce infestation by fecal–oral transmitted parasites
(Hart 1990, 1992). While both behaviors are known to occur in domestic animals,
evidence that they actually reduce levels of parasitism is scant. For example,
domestic horses create permanent defecation sites and it has been suggested that
this selective clustering of fecal eliminations in space serves to sequester parasites
allowing subsequent avoidance during foraging (Taylor 1954; O¨dberg & FrancisSmith
1976). Similar observations have also been made in wild primates (Gilbert
1997), but direct links between selective defecation and reduced parasitism are
lacking in both groups. Selective foraging in the form of fecal avoidance has been
documented in cattle (Taylor 1954), sheep (Crofton 1957; Cooper et al. 1977,
2000; Hutchings et al. 1998), horses (O¨dberg & Francis-Smith 1977), and captive
reindeer (Moe et al. 1999). By selectively avoiding grazing near feces, animals are
thought to reduce consumption of parasites, thereby lowering their infection
rates. Unlike selective defecation, selective foraging has been associated with
reduced parasite intake (Michel 1955; Cooper et al. 2000), which suggests that this
behavior may serve as an effective antiparasite strategy for grazing ungulates...Dik-dik 
feeding trials showed that individuals preferentially avoided feces
when feeding. Individuals presented with a choice of calf feed in the vicinity of either 
'dung' or 'no dung' took significantly more bites from the 'no dung'
treatment (Paired t-test: t ¼ )3.57, df ¼ 30, p ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3)...In the current study, larval
abundance counts around different feces formations showed that dung middens
do have higher infective larvae concentrations in their immediate vicinity when
compared to single fecal pellet groups and control areas. However, it is unclear
whether these high concentrations of larvae actually remain confined to midden
sites...Furthermore,territorial male Grant’s gazelles were found to have significantly higher strongyle
egg counts than did either non-territorial males or females, possibly because these
males spend more time on territories and in closer proximity to dung middens
(Ezenwa 2004b)...Even if fecal avoidance is an effective antiparasite strategy used by some wild
ungulates, there are significant costs associated with this behavior that could lead
to individual- and species-level variation in responses to feces.

Garine-Wichatitsky et al. 1999: For instance, grazing herbivores have evolved
a tendency to avoid foraging near recently dropped
faeces as a mean of reducing infestation from faecalborne
parasites (Michel, 1955; Hart, 1994 for
review)

Brambilla et al. 2013: In reindeer, Rangifer tarandus, the
presence of abomasal macroparasites reduces the fertility rate of
females (Albon et al. 2002; Hughes et al. 2009), and, as parasite
burden increases, body weight and back fat depth decrease in both pregnant 
and nonpregnant individuals (Stien et al. 2002; Hughes
et al. 2009). Parasite load can also affect growth (Ezenwa & Jolles
2008) and symmetry (Lagesen & Folstad 1998) of secondary sexual
characters in ungulates...Normally, grazing distribution patterns in large herbivores is
affected by abiotic and biotic factors (e.g. distance to water, ground
morphology and slope, quality and quantity of food; Bailey et al.
1996), but they can also be influenced by the quantity of faeces
(Cooper et al. 2000; van der Wal et al. 2000; Hutchings et al. 2001a,
2002b). Previous studies have shown that herbivores use behavioural 
antiparasitic tactics to reduce infection such as the use
of defecation sites to prevent parasite dispersal (Ezenwa 2004; Apio
et al. 2006) or the avoidance of areas highly contaminated by faeces
during foraging (Hutchings et al. 2003)...

van der Wal et al. (2000) observed avoidance of faecal-contaminated
areas in reindeer but did not find a correlation between the potential
infectivity of the vegetation eaten and the parasitic levels of
individuals.

Fankhauser et al 2008: Grazing intensity on the entire site also did not decrease
after dung was brought in. Although the proportions of
behaviour types (“grazing”, “lying”, “walking” and “standing”;
Table 1) significantly differed between control and
trial periods (chi-square test, p<0.001), changes were in
fact to the opposite than expected. “Grazing” was more
frequent in the trial (39%) than in the control period (26%;
chi-square test for “grazing” and “lying/walking/standing”,
